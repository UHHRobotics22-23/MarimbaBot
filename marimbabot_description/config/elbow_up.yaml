# elbow_up.yaml
# Specifies the upper and lower limits of ur5 joints in the urdf.
# elbow_up restricts the arm to move like a marimba player.

# Limits that align with the robots joint limits (+/- 2*pi) may allow
# joint configurations that lead to protective stop.
# To prevent that we substract a safety tolerance of 0.002.
