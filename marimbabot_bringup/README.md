# TAMS Master Project 2022/2023 - Bring up the system

This is main entrance of the whole project, so you need two steps to bringup the whole system.

1.  Launch the `marimbabot_ur5_bringup.launch` to bringup the serivce of the UR5 robot. **By launching this file, the robot's gripper could reinitialize itself, so what is holded by the gripper could fall down**
2. Launch the `marimbabot.launch` to run the main system of our project.
